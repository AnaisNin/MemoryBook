Jon Kabat-Zinn, professeur MIT, MBSR = Mindfulness Based Stress Reduction
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jon_Kabat-Zinn
Founder of Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction
Jon Kaba-Zinn is the creator of the Stress Reduction Clinic and the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society
Kabat-Zinn was a student of Buddhist teachers such as Thich Nhat Hanh and Zen Master Seung Sahn and a founding member of Cambridge Zen Center. 
His practice of yoga and studies with Buddhist teachers led him to integrate their teachings with scientific findings. 
He teaches mindfulness, which he says can help people cope with stress, anxiety, pain, and illness. 
The stress reduction program created by Kabat-Zinn, mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), is offered by medical centers, hospitals, and health maintenance organizations.
In 1979 he founded the Stress Reduction Clinic at the University of Massachusetts Medical School, 
where he adapted the Buddhist teachings on mindfulness and developed the Stress Reduction and Relaxation Program. 
He subsequently renamed the structured eight-week course Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). 
He removed the Buddhist framework and eventually downplayed any connection between mindfulness and Buddhism, 
instead putting MBSR in a scientific context.
He subsequently also founded the Center for Mindfulness in Medicine, Health Care, and Society at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. 
His secular technique, which combines meditation and Hatha yoga, has since spread worldwide.
The course aims to help patients cope with stress, pain, and illness by using what is called "moment-to-moment awareness."
Kabat-Zinn's MBSR began to get increasing notice with the publication of his first book, Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain, and Illness (Delta, 1991), which gave detailed instructions for the practice.
In 1994 Kabat-Zinn's second book, titled Wherever You Go, There You Are, became a national bestseller.

He is the author of numerous scientific papers on the clinical applications of mindfulness in medicine and health care,
and of a number of books for the lay public: 
Full Catastrophe Living: Using the Wisdom of Your Body and Mind to Face Stress, Pain and Illness (Delta, 1991); 
Wherever You Go, There You Are: Mindfulness Meditation in Everyday Life (Hyperion, 1994); 
Coming to Our Senses: Healing Ourselves and the World Through Mindfulness (Hyperion, 2005); 
and Arriving at Your Own Door: 108 Lessons in Mindfulness (Hyperion, 2007). 
He is also co-author, with his wife Myla, of Everyday Blessings: The Inner Work of Mindful Parenting (Hyperion, 1997); 
and with Williams, Teasdale, and Segal, of The Mindful Way Through Depression: Freeing Yourself from Chronic Unhappiness (Guilford, 2007).

Equilibre psychique et émotionnel

Self thoughts
-------------

Ce que je cherche: épanouissement, apaisement, sérénité
Apprivoi
Ce qui te rassure: besoin d'une sensation de controle.
How did you arrive there:
- anxiety Babou
- stress work
-> deep feeling of unbalance, loss of control, loss of purpose
