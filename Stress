The effect of stress

Study when you enter an exam room with the belief that you'll fail, you'll actually perform worse than if you enter with self-confidence
-> source? Presence?

I feel stressed when..
  Loss of control. Powerless feeling.
  I have to do something and I think I'm not able to do it (skills related, and self-confidence)
  public speaking, judgment of other people, fear that they will think I'm under skilled
  
When I feel stressed, I..
  freak out, intellectual paralysis -> my brain is spinning crazy but unable to analyze things and find any solution
  -> strong decrease of intellectual performance 
  - I feel like there are too many things to do and i'll never manage to learn/do everything. 
  -> in life: just a little delta of busyness turns into the feeling of overload. 
  Breeze. Unload. Reframe and put into perspective. You just need to downstep of a little delta to make the situation manageable. 
  -> at work: yes, the extent of skills is very large, as the many fields in the world. This is the bottom of Ionnis's big mountain. It seems huge and impossible to climb. But you need to do baby steps. No steps at all won't bring you anywhwere. Baby steps by baby steps. Force yourself not to panic and freak out, because this actually impedes your brain from functioning. Consider it as a challenge and set your mindset to consider it as an exciting opportunity to learn new things, to improve and to progress, and convince yourself that you'll manage it. 
 
What I can do:
see self healing.

- Parkinson's law - The perceived complexity of a task will expand to fill the time you allowed.
  Parkinson’s Law dictates that a task will swell in (perceived) importance and complexity in relation to the time allotted for completion.
- Always ask what's the worse that can happen. Take the analytical frameworks, the capabilities you have, apply them to you fears.
