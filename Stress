The effect of stress

Study when you enter an exam room with the belief that you'll fail, you'll actually perform worse than if you enter with self-confidence
-> source? Presence?

I feel stressed when..
  loss of control
  I have to do something and I think I'm not able to do it (skills related, and self-confidence)
  public speaking, judgment of other people, fear that they will think I'm under skilled
  
When I feel stressed, I..
  freak out, intellectual paralysis -> my brain is spinning crazy but unable to analyze things and find any solution
  -> strong decrease of intellectual performance 
  - I feel like there are too many things to do and i'll never manage to learn/do everything. 
  -> in life: just a little delta of busyness turns into the feeling of overload. 
  Breeze. Unload. Reframe and put into perspective. You just need to downstep of a little delta to make the situation manageable. 
  -> at work: yes, the extent of skills is very large, as the many fields in the world. This is the bottom of Ionnis's big mountain. It seems huge and impossible to climb. But you need to do baby steps. No steps at all won't bring you anywhwere. Baby steps by baby steps. Force yourself not to panic and freak out, because this actually impedes your brain from functioning. Consider it as a challenge and set your mindset to consider it as an exciting opportunity to learn new things, to improve and to progress, and convince yourself that you'll manage it. 
 
What I can do:
  - recover control, even for unrelated small everyday life things (laundry, ..) -> put a structure, define small tasks, do them.
  - sport. 
  - sleep. When you're sleep deprived, you are stressed and unhappy and over sensitive to small obstacles and defeats. 
    Force yourself to go to bed before midnight. 
  - food.
  - look for insights. You're not the first one who had this kind of issue, and some other people came out with solutions. Don't try to re-invent the wheel, first look for solutions already out there in the world.
    -> google, TED talks, books, youtube. 
  - in general: acknowledge the issue. Define exactly what the issue is. Think with clarity about what you can do to address the issue and improve the sitution -> small, actionable things. Do them, starting little, without discouraging yourself. Do not think about the future and if you'll manage or not. 
  Not doing anything will not improve things. When you are 
  
You need to learn to recognize when things are slipping out of control and you're feeling overwhelmed, overly anxious.
Once you spotted out that there's someting wrong, breathe, calm down and define thoughtfully what the issue is.
Then analyze the situation as cleverly and as shrewdly as possible.
