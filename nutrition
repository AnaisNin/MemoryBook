https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nutrient
A nutrient is a substance used by an organism to survive, grow, and reproduce.
Some nutrients can be metabolically converted to smaller molecules in the process of releasing energy, 
such as for carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and fermentation products (ethanol or vinegar), leading to end-products of water and carbon dioxide.

Essential nutrients for animals are 
- the energy sources, 
- some of the amino acids that are combined to create proteins, 
- a subset of fatty acids, 
- vitamins and 
- certain minerals.

 Nutrients may be organic or inorganic: organic compounds include most compounds containing carbon, while all other chemicals are inorganic. 
 Inorganic nutrients include nutrients such as iron, selenium, and zinc, while organic nutrients include, among many others, energy-providing compounds and vitamins.

A classification used primarily to describe nutrient needs of animals divides nutrients into macronutrients and micronutrients. 
Consumed in relatively large amounts (grams or ounces), macronutrients (carbohydrates, fats, proteins, water) are used primarily to generate energy or to incorporate into tissues for growth and repair. 
Micronutrients are needed in smaller amounts (milligrams or micrograms); they have subtle biochemical and physiological roles in cellular processes, like vascular functions or nerve conduction. Inadequate amounts of essential nutrients, or diseases that interfere with absorption, result in a deficiency state that compromises growth, survival and reproduction.

The chemical compounds that provide bulk energy are classified as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.
Macronutrients provide energy:
1. Carbohydrates are compounds made up of types of sugar. 
Carbohydrates are classified according to their number of sugar units: monosaccharides (such as glucose and fructose), disaccharides (such as sucrose and lactose), oligosaccharides, and polysaccharides (such as starch, glycogen, and cellulose).
2. Proteins are organic compounds that consist of amino acids joined by peptide bonds. 
Since the body cannot manufacture some of the amino acids (termed essential amino acids), the diet must supply them. 
Through digestion, proteins are broken down by proteases back into free amino acids.
3. Fats consist of a glycerin molecule with three fatty acids attached. 
Fatty acid molecules contain a -COOH group attached to unbranched hydrocarbon chains connected by single bonds alone (saturated fatty acids) or by both double and single bonds (unsaturated fatty acids). Fats are needed for construction and maintenance of cell membranes, to maintain a stable body temperature, and to sustain the health of skin and hair. Because the body does not manufacture certain fatty acids (termed essential fatty acids), they must be obtained through one's diet.
(Ethanol (C2H5OH) supplies calories.
lcoholic beverages are considered empty calorie foods because, other than calories, they contribute no essential nutrients.)

Micronutrients support metabolism.
4. Dietary minerals are generally trace elements, salts, or ions such as copper and iron. Some of these minerals are essential to human metabolism.
The essential nutrient elements for humans, listed in order of Recommended Dietary Allowance (expressed as a mass), are 
potassium, chlorine, sodium, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, iron, zinc, manganese, copper, iodine, chromium, molybdenum, selenium and cobalt (the last as a component of vitamin B12). 
5. Vitamins are organic compounds essential to the body. They usually act as coenzymes or cofactors for various proteins in the body.
Vitamins are organic molecules essential for an organism that are not classified as amino acids or fatty acids. 
They commonly function as enzymatic cofactors, metabolic regulators or antioxidants. 
Humans require thirteen vitamins in their diet, the list: vitamins A, C, D, E, K, 
Thiamine (B1), Riboflavin (B2), Niacin (B3), Pantothenic Acid (B5), Vitamin B6, Biotin (B7), Folate (B9) and Vitamin B12.

In the case of humans, there are nine amino acids, two fatty acids, thirteen vitamins and fifteen minerals that are considered essential nutrients.

Protein is made up of amino acids, the building blocks for tissue, skin and muscle. 
Twenty amino acids, 10 of which can only be obtained from dietary sources, make up the complex molecules of protein. 
Both fish and beef are excellent complete protein sources, meaning they contain all the essential amino acids.

Add alkaline-forming food to beat stress
Your body’s pH can affect everything from sleep to body composition. Plant-based foods can be alkaline-forming, reducing stress by supporting your body’s efforts to maintain its optimum pH of 7.35. While the pH of a food outside of the body doesn’t matter, adding more alkaline-forming foods like lemons — acidic on the outside, but alkaline-forming once digested — can help you feel your best. Chlorophyll content is also a good indicator of a food’s alkaline-forming ability. The greener the better! 
Making time for deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, or stretching can also be alkaline-forming, bringing balance to your life — and helping balance your body’s pH.

While it’s not possible to eliminate every stressful situation in life, there is one kind of stress you have complete control over: nutritional stress.

Energy
Stimulants like caffeine and sugar keep your body on a blood sugar roller coaster, racing through a series of highs and lows throughout your day. And if you’re not properly hydrated, you can perpetuate these cravings, resulting in a vicious cycle that can leave you starved of energy — and extra stressed.
not-so-secret tips on how to naturally keep your energy levels up (without relying on caffeine):
Energize through Nourishment, Not Stimulants
Glycemic Index: Get Lasting Energy
Hydrate for Energy
maintaining hydration with clear liquids and electrolytes, and choosing low glycemic foods will also keep you focused, energized, and help you avoid the dreaded mid-afternoon slump.

There are two basic types of energy: energy from stimulation and energy from nourishment. Instead of relying on stimulants for energy, fill up on foods that give you energy through proper nourishment.
Energy from Stimulation
Short term, quick energy from stimulants like caffeine and sugar create a biological debt. Biological debt occurs because fatigue sets in as soon as the stimulant energy wears off, creating a vicious cycle, with long-term health impacts (aside from the obvious need for more stimulation).
Energy from Nourishment
Energy from nourishment provides sustained, long-term, whole food energy with a balance of healthy fats, complex carbs, and protein. Getting your energy through nourishment is an investment in long-term vitality—without creating a debt.

Boost your energy and general health by relying on plant-based whole foods to give you the complex carbohydrates, protein, healthy fats and vitamins and minerals your body needs.
Your body needs healthy nutrient dense foods to help you maintain long-lasting energy, and a positive mood.
Why consume more plant-based meals? Because they’re nutrient dense, help you feel fuller for longer, and include many low-glycemic foods—all of which help to manage your weight (not to mention your appetite). With nutrient dense foods you’re getting more nutrition with fewer calories. Plus, these meals are high in fiber, healthy fats and protein, which satisfy to help keep you from constantly feeling hungry.

leguminous plant (Legumineuses = legumes secs)
Can be considered as starch (feculent) because rich in amidon = starch
ckickpeas, lentils, peas, fava beans,
Rassasiantes, les légumineuses sont riches en protéines, en glucides et pauvres en matières grasses. Elles représentent une bonne source de calcium, phosphore, magnésium, fer et vitamines B1 et B2. Il faut également noter qu’elles possèdent un index glycémique bas. Pour toutes ces raisons, les légumineuses méritent une place de choix dans votre assiette.
Il faut les laisser tremper longtemps et bien les cuire pour faciliter leur digestion
http://sante.lefigaro.fr/mieux-etre/nutrition-aliments/legumes-secs-legumineuses/quest-ce-que-cest
lentilles: riches en fer
pois (casses ou petits pois): 20% proteines
feves: protéines, des fibres, des vitamines (B et C), du fer, du potassium et du magnésium
haricots: Ils contiennent entre 16 et 25% de protéines et sont riches en fer, manganèse, cuivre et folate (vitamine B9)
chickpeas: riches en glucides facilement assimilables, en protéines, en manganèse, cuivre et folate
The glycemic index indicates the impact of carbohydrates on blood sugar levels; the higher a food's number, the more it increases blood sugar. On a scale where 100 is pure sugar (glucose), white rice has a glycemic index of 64, while lentils are low on the index with a rating of 29


Note:
Healthy nutrition requires to select the type of food maximizing the ratio nutrients vs calories, but also proportions.
50% vegetables -> if you're hungry, that's what you need to eat more
20% fruits -> contain sugar, so not too much
    seeds -> full of nutrients, but also loads of calories in there..
