Add alkaline-forming food to beat stress
Your body’s pH can affect everything from sleep to body composition. Plant-based foods can be alkaline-forming, reducing stress by supporting your body’s efforts to maintain its optimum pH of 7.35. While the pH of a food outside of the body doesn’t matter, adding more alkaline-forming foods like lemons — acidic on the outside, but alkaline-forming once digested — can help you feel your best. Chlorophyll content is also a good indicator of a food’s alkaline-forming ability. The greener the better! 
Making time for deep breathing exercises, meditation, yoga, or stretching can also be alkaline-forming, bringing balance to your life — and helping balance your body’s pH.

While it’s not possible to eliminate every stressful situation in life, there is one kind of stress you have complete control over: nutritional stress.

Energy
Stimulants like caffeine and sugar keep your body on a blood sugar roller coaster, racing through a series of highs and lows throughout your day. And if you’re not properly hydrated, you can perpetuate these cravings, resulting in a vicious cycle that can leave you starved of energy — and extra stressed.
not-so-secret tips on how to naturally keep your energy levels up (without relying on caffeine):
Energize through Nourishment, Not Stimulants
Glycemic Index: Get Lasting Energy
Hydrate for Energy
maintaining hydration with clear liquids and electrolytes, and choosing low glycemic foods will also keep you focused, energized, and help you avoid the dreaded mid-afternoon slump.

There are two basic types of energy: energy from stimulation and energy from nourishment. Instead of relying on stimulants for energy, fill up on foods that give you energy through proper nourishment.
Energy from Stimulation
Short term, quick energy from stimulants like caffeine and sugar create a biological debt. Biological debt occurs because fatigue sets in as soon as the stimulant energy wears off, creating a vicious cycle, with long-term health impacts (aside from the obvious need for more stimulation).
Energy from Nourishment
Energy from nourishment provides sustained, long-term, whole food energy with a balance of healthy fats, complex carbs, and protein. Getting your energy through nourishment is an investment in long-term vitality—without creating a debt.

Boost your energy and general health by relying on plant-based whole foods to give you the complex carbohydrates, protein, healthy fats and vitamins and minerals your body needs.
Your body needs healthy nutrient dense foods to help you maintain long-lasting energy, and a positive mood.
Why consume more plant-based meals? Because they’re nutrient dense, help you feel fuller for longer, and include many low-glycemic foods—all of which help to manage your weight (not to mention your appetite). With nutrient dense foods you’re getting more nutrition with fewer calories. Plus, these meals are high in fiber, healthy fats and protein, which satisfy to help keep you from constantly feeling hungry.
